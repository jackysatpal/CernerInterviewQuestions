# CernerInterviewQuestions
Common interview question from Cerner

## Questions
* Tell me about the reason you left the previous company?  
* Tell me the previous project you have done or tools you used like StackOverflow?  
* Design a class (give different methods and variables that will be used) that will provide information related to an allergy which includes symptoms, who reported the allergy, severity, date reported etc.
* Building a diagram and writing some code for a system to tell users when to take medication  
* When did you take feedback from others? What were the results?
* Tell about a project you are most proud of
* How do you approach if a client encountered an error in the application?
* How do you approach if a client encountered multiple errors in the application?
* Design a class which stores demographic information of a person like name, address, phone number, male/female. What if the person has any prefix to the name, multiple phone numbers/addresses, how will you handle dob in case of multiple locations(If a person is both at 12 PM in USA on a date, then that date is different from date in India), how will you handle the validations of these fields when the user enters the values. Try using enums  
* What is your favorite data structure? I told Linked List and Binary Search Tree. Then he asked me to write the representation of the word CERNER in the form of Binary Search Tree.
* What are your favorite programming languages?
* Tell me about your internship experience.
* Tell me how you were able to work in a new company and get used to that culture?
* Tell me your experience in learning new technologies and the difficulties you faced during that. 
* What is the difference between a thread and process?
* Tell me a time where you automated a task to make your life easier.
* How do you troubleshoot a problem
* It wouldn't hurt to review data structures and time complexities of various algorithms.
* What is static, final and difference between both?  
* Use Linked List with CERNER as input. (Just diagram)  
* Design a class that tells you the temperature of a person. You also needed to have a method that could tell if they had a fever or not. You had to incorporate celsius and Fahrenheit degrees and the method of measuring the temperature (mouth, armpits). 
* Design a class that alerts the nurse about the frequency of medication to each patient. The frequency could be hourly, daily or a patient could be advised to take it for lifetime when needed.  
* You have been asked to build a system for entering and displaying the allergies that patients may have. The allergy will have its own set of symptoms or reactions. The allergy will also have a spectrum of severity which the clinician should be aware of, and allergies can be reported by the patient or by next of kin.  
* What's the difference between a class and an object  
* Reverse a string
* What language did you learn most recently and how did you learn it
* Given 3 coins of value 1, 3, and 5 find the minimum coins required to get to the number x
* Describe 3 primitive data types.
* Explain a time you had to debug code. What did you learn?
* Describe your biggest bug.
* User inputs a sentence (words are separated by space). Your job is to print the next-to-last-word of the sentence?
* User inputs numbers separated by comma. Your job is to print the number of ways that summing up 4 numbers equals to 0?  
* Take a line from user input (standard input) and remove all the vowels. Return the string with the vowels removed. Do this in a loop for every newly entered line. (This last part was pre-initialized for you).  
* Situation where you are proactive rather than reactive  
* What is the time complexity of insert, delete, search of this data structure  
* http://poj.org/problem?id=2575
* You have a list of tasks how will you prioritize them?
